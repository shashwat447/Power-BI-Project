# Power-BI-Project
In this project, I worked with three distinct datasets named Call Centre, Churn, and Diversity and Inclusion. Each dataset provided valuable insights into different aspects of a company's operations, customer relations, and workplace diversity. The main objective of the project was to extract meaningful patterns, trends, and correlations from the datasets, which could help the company optimize its performance, reduce churn, and foster a more inclusive work environment.
## 1. Call Centre Dataset:
The Call Centre dataset contained information related to customer interactions, call volumes, response times, and customer satisfaction metrics. Through this dataset, I aimed to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of the call center's operations. By studying key performance indicators (KPIs) like average handling time, first-call resolution rate, and customer feedback, I identified areas for improvement in customer service processes and agent training.

## 2. Churn Dataset:
The Churn dataset provided valuable information on customer attrition. It included customer demographics, transaction history, and reasons for churn. My primary goal with this dataset was to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn. Using machine learning algorithms, I developed a churn prediction model that could help the company proactively retain valuable customers and implement targeted retention strategies.

## 3. Diversity and Inclusion Dataset:
The Diversity and Inclusion dataset focused on employee demographics, job roles, and responses to diversity-related surveys. By analyzing this dataset, I aimed to evaluate the company's commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace. Through statistical analysis and data visualization, I assessed the representation of various demographic groups, identified potential disparities, and suggested actionable strategies to promote diversity and inclusivity.

There are separeate dashboard for each of the dataset mentioned above.
# Dashboard Overview
 I began with an executive summary that highlighted the main objectives of my project. I outlined the datasets I worked on, including Call Centre, Churn, and Diversity and Inclusion, and provided a high-level overview of the key insights I derived from each dataset. The main goal was to capture the attention of stakeholders and present the most impactful KPIs and findings.
## 1. Call Centre Dataset:
In the Call Centre dataset, I analyzed customer interactions, call volumes, response times, and customer satisfaction metrics. By studying KPIs such as Average Handling Time (AHT), First-Call Resolution Rate, and Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), I identified areas for improvement in customer service processes and agent training. The dashboard highlighted these key findings to drive customer service improvements.

## 2. Churn Dataset:
For the Churn dataset, I investigated customer attrition factors, exploring customer demographics, transaction history, and churn reasons. Using machine learning algorithms, I developed a churn prediction model that enabled us to proactively retain valuable customers and implement targeted retention strategies. The dashboard showcased the churn rate, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and the effectiveness of the churn prediction model.

## 3. Diversity and Inclusion Dataset:
The Diversity and Inclusion dataset provided insights into workplace diversity and inclusivity. I analyzed employee demographics, job roles, and survey responses to evaluate our company's commitment to fostering a diverse work environment. Through statistical analysis, I assessed the representation of various demographic groups and identified areas for improvement. The dashboard visually presented diversity metrics and progress over time.
## Conclusion and Recommendations:
In conclusion, the dashboard presented a concise summary of the main project takeaways. It showcased actionable recommendations based on the insights gained, guiding the company in making data-driven decisions. Overall, the project contributed to improving company performance, customer retention, and workplace diversity and inclusion efforts, aligning the organization with modern values.
